**About HarmonyOS**

HarmonyOS is made for developers of smart mirrors and other DIY IoT devices. 
These operating system images are unstable and not made for professional or production use.

**HarmonyOS Device Variants**

*HarmonyOS will come in multiple variants to tailor to specific devices.*

x86 Variants: These builds are made for devices using the x86 processor architecture, and are built directly from Debian Linux. 

ARM Variants: These builds are made for devices using the ARM processor architecture, and are built directly from Debian Linux ARM Variants.

RPi Variants: These builds are made for Raspberry Pi devices, and are pre-installed versions of HarmonyOS, built from Raspbian Linux for compatibility.

**HarmonyOS Use-Case Variants**

*HarmonyOS will come in multiple variants to tailor to specific use-cases.*

Smart mirror variants: These builds will come with the MagicMirror2 software pre-installed and support for microphone arrays. 

Smart speaker/HiFi stereo/Smart display variants (not available right now): These builds will come with support for the Google AI Voice components, camera, USB/GPIO sound cards, and touch display. These builds will only be available for

**NOTICE**

These OS images come with software pre-installed. It is highly likely that pre-installed software will not be completely up to date, so you will have to find the software developer's GitHub repo, or website for information on updating.

**These OS images are coming soon. Pending approval for use from software developers.**
